Hi, I'm Samir Musali, a Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the industry. I have a strong background in building and improving new integrations, creating and maintaining customer-facing tools and libraries, automating provisioning processes, and optimizing scripts.

I have a professional background that includes working as a Software Engineer at BenchSci, LogDNA, and NuraLogix Corporation. My experience at BenchSci involved building SLO-based Alerting Policies and Dashboards around critical API endpoints and automating GCP Monitoring resources using Terraform. At LogDNA, I led projects and developed new integrations, maintained and improved customer-facing tools and libraries, and architected CI/CD pipelines. At NuraLogix, I debugged and optimized scripts in Python and Matlab, implemented simple API calls, and designed unit-testing scripts.

In addition to my professional experience, I have a solid academic background. I started my studies in Computer Science at Baku State University but later transferred to the University of Waterloo, where I received my Honours Bachelor of Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Arts in Innovation and Technology Management at the University of Tartu.

I also have a strong portfolio of projects and certifications. I have also earned certificates from Coursera and DataCamp, including Machine Learning, Software Product Management, and Data Analysis. I am a motivated, knowledgeable, and experienced software engineer with a passion for developing and improving software solutions.
